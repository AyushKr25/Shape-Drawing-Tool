# Shape Drawing and Calculation Tool (ShapeArchitect)

A web-based application to create, draw, and calculate geometric shapes using strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of OOP concepts in a modern web environment and is developed as part of an academic assignment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Create and manage multiple geometric shapes
- Draw shapes visually using a canvas
- Calculate area and perimeter of shapes
- Apply core Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Demonstrate clean, modular architecture
- Deploy a production-ready web application

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Abstraction**: Abstract `Shape` class with mandatory methods
- **Inheritance**: `Shape → Polygon → Rectangle / Triangle`, `Shape → Circle`
- **Encapsulation**: Private properties with controlled getters and setters
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden `draw()` and calculation methods
- **Method Overloading**: Multiple `scale()` and calculation variations
- **Interfaces (JS-style)**: `Drawable`, `Resizable`
- **Static Members**: Unit conversion utilities
- **Exception Handling**: Custom error classes for validation
- **Collections**: Map for unique shapes, stack-based undo operations
